# Book Search Engine

## Description

This book search engine allows users to search for books using google books.  Users are able to sign up and log into the site.  Once they are logged in, they have the ability to save books that they find from the search engine and view all of their saved books.  When viewing all saved books, they have the option to remove them if desired.  This code has been refactored to change from RESTful API practices in order to use GraphQL.

In the root directory of the program, ensure all packages are available by typing 'npm init' and 'npm install' in the command line. Then the program should be available to execute with both the front and back end servers with "node run develop".
